• Where existing text, labels, badges, icons, or graphic elements are located — these must NEVER be covered

• The dominant lighting direction and color temperature of the scene

- The person must be fully visible from head to at least knee level, not cropped at top.
- Maintain the person's original appearance, face, and clothing.
- Do NOT add any products, objects, text, or logos.

STRICT PROHIBITIONS:

SECONDARY RULE — PERSON USES THE PRODUCT — NON-NEGOTIABLE
================================================================================
The person MUST be actively using or interacting with the EXACT product shown in Image 2.
Natural use modes (choose the most fitting for the product category):
  • One hand holds the product at chest/waist height while the other hand applies it to skin
  • Both hands present the product toward the camera, label facing forward
  • Person applies the product to their arm, neck, or face with a natural gesture
Product MUST be:
  - Clearly visible and fully in frame — NEVER hidden or cropped
  - Label / front face toward the camera (slight angle acceptable)
  - Reproduced from Image 2 with exact colors, label text, and shape
Any output where the product from Image 2 is NOT visible and in the person's interaction is INVALID.
================================================================================

STEP 1 — ANALYZE IMAGE 1 CAREFULLY:
Before compositing, examine the background and identify:
• Where existing text, badges, labels, or graphic elements are — they must NEVER be covered
• The exact open space available for the person (within the allowed zone above)
• Lighting direction, color temperature, and ambient light quality

STEP 2 — COMPOSE THE ADVERTISING SCENE:
CREATIVE BRIEF (execute this, but always within the zone constraint above):
${productPrompt}

PERSON — TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Match face, hair color/style, skin tone, and general aesthetic EXACTLY from Image 3
- The person must look like the same individual — this is non-negotiable
- FRAMING: show the person from HEAD to at least KNEE — full upright standing posture
- BODY POSITION: the person stands upright and confident; their body is ${zoneBodyPosition}
- FACING: the person faces slightly toward the center of the canvas (toward the text area), body stays inside the allowed zone
- Clothing may adapt to the scene naturally

PRODUCT — TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use ONLY the product from Image 2 — do not invent or substitute any other object
- The person is ACTIVELY USING or interacting with Image 2 — applying to skin, or presenting to camera
- Product at CHEST or TORSO HEIGHT — clearly visible, label facing camera (slight angle is fine)
- Preserve the product's EXACT colors, labels, logo, and proportions — zero alteration
- The product must be FULLY IN FRAME — never cropped or partially out of canvas

ABSOLUTE RULES — VIOLATIONS NOT ACCEPTABLE:
- The person MUST be visibly using, holding, or applying the product from Image 2 — a person with empty hands and no visible product is NOT acceptable
- The person and product must be FULLY OPAQUE and SOLIDLY VISIBLE at 100% opacity — NEVER fading, dissolving, soft edges, or any transparency
- Lighting must match the background scene naturally — same direction, same color temperature
- No added text, watermarks, logos, or extra objects
- Authentic feel — genuine expression, natural posture, not stiff or stock-photo generic

COMPOSITION GUIDELINES:
- Place the product WELL INSIDE the available zone — leave at least 10% breathing room from any zone boundary.
- The product must be FULLY OPAQUE and SOLIDLY VISIBLE — do NOT apply fading, dissolving, or transparency.
- Cast a subtle contact shadow only if it stays entirely within the product zone.
- Match the background's lighting direction and color temperature naturally.
- When in doubt about scale, go slightly smaller — negative space reads as premium.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- No hands, fingers, arms, or body parts — the product must never be held
- No text, logos, watermarks, icons, or decorative symbols
- The product MUST NOT overlap any existing text or graphic elements — place it in open space only.
